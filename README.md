User account creation: You will need to create a user registration page where people can sign up and create an account. This will allow users to log in to your website and create games, as well as join games created by other users.

Game creation: Users should be able to create games by specifying the location, time, and date of the game. They should also be able to specify the skill level required to join the game, the number of players needed, and any other relevant details.

Game search: Users should be able to search for games based on location, date, skill level, and other criteria. They should also be able to view details about each game, such as the number of players who have already joined.

Mobile optimization: Given that users may be accessing your website from their mobile devices, you will want to ensure that your website is optimized for mobile screens.
